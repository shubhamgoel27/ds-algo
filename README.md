## Overview

This repository serves as a personal collection of data structure and algorithm problems, including implementations, explanations, and test cases. It aims to provide a comprehensive guide to common problems and their solutions, making it easier to review and practice.

## Repository Structure

Each problem is typically contained in its own Python file, named descriptively (e.g., `binary_tree_vertical_traversal.py`). Many files include both the solution and associated test cases.

## Problem Categories

The repository covers a wide range of topics, including but not limited to:

- Binary Trees
- Linked Lists
- Arrays and Strings
- Heaps and Priority Queues
- Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
- Design Problems (e.g., LRU Cache)

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ds-algo-problems.git
   cd ds-algo-problems
   ```

2. **Navigate to a Specific Problem**:
   Browse the repository to find a problem you're interested in.

3. **Run the Solution**:
   Each solution file can be run independently:
   ```bash
   python path/to/solution.py
   ```

4. **Explore the Code**:
   Each file typically contains:
   - Problem description (in comments)
   - Solution implementation
   - Test cases (where applicable)

## Testing

Many solutions include built-in test cases. 

Look for output indicating whether tests passed or failed.

## Contributing
