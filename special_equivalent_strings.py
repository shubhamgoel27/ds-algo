        A word is special equivalent if it can be rearranged to match another 
        word by swapping even indexed characters with each other and odd indexed 
        characters with each other.

# Hints for future reference:
# 1. Understand the concept of special equivalence and how it relates to character positions.
# 2. Consider edge cases, such as empty strings or strings of different lengths.
# 3. Explore the efficiency of your approach; can it be optimized further?
# 4. Think about how to generalize the solution for larger datasets or different constraints.
